# SimpleDatabase
An implementation of a simple in-memory database, similar to Redis, that I decided to implement as an independent project.
Additions and optimizations that are to come:
1. Modification to include storage for a wider variety of data types
2. Addition of Java Generics
3. Modification for Parallel User Access
4. Thread Safety
5. Ability to save data once session has ended
6. Continuous time and space optimizations
