# SimpleDatabase
An implementation of a simple in-memory database, similar to Redis, that I decided to implement as an independent project.
Additions and optimizations that are to come:
1. Modification to include storage for a wider variety of data types
2. Addition of Java Generics
3. Modification for Parallel User Access
4. Thread Safe
